/* Alien Colors #1:
Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
*/
// Version that passes the if test
var alienColor = "green";
if (alienColor == "green") {
    console.log("Congrats! You have earned 5 points");
}
// Version that fails the if test
alienColor == "red";
if (alienColor == "green") {
    // No output
}
